GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE VERIFICATION FILE TEMPLATE

When you set up Google Search Console, Google will provide you with a specific verification file.
Replace this file with the actual verification file Google gives you.

The file will be named something like: googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html
And should be placed in the /public folder.

Example process:
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Add your property: https://thedebuthub.com  
3. Choose "HTML file upload" verification method
4. Download the verification file Google provides
5. Replace this template file with the actual verification file
6. Deploy your changes
7. Go back to Search Console and click "Verify"

The verification file will contain content similar to:
google-site-verification: googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html

This is just a template - replace with the actual file from Google!
